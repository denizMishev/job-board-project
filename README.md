# Devjobs - Job board for Software Development roles 
[Link to live app](https://job-board-project-a6335.web.app/)

## **Project description**

The app uses a React & HTML&CSS front-end and Firebase authentication and database. It offers user authentication functionality, searching for key words contained in job offers / job location, filtering for full time job contracts only, pagination, both logged in and logged out users are able to apply for jobs by sending an application with a required attached file and the app will keep track of the jobs a logged in user has applied for, I have also added a theme switch for users who prefer dark mode.

## **Built with:**
- React 18.2.0
- Firebase 10.6.0
- React error boundary 4.0.11
- Emotion.js 11.11.1
- React-spinners 0.13.8
- Prettier 2.7.3

## **Local setup**
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`

The app will run on a localhost URL which will open automatically.

### Work in progress ###

I am currently working on adding a new feature to this project - a user dashboard which will showcase the user's applied for jobs, saved jobs and also saved searches.
